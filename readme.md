# what is decipher
decipher is a cipher app, actually this software is only a frame, i will make some basic feature by plugin i write, but that mean you can(maybe) make a minecraft out of this

# the plugin system
it's dangerous, i've tried very hard to stop plugin from getting real fs module(or other dangrous module), but i'm just bad at this, so using this software mean you know the danger of others code running on your machine, and you have check every lines of code in plugin you download, and it's not my fault if your "system32\\" got delete
